# DNA-Classification

## Summary
Exploring the world of bioinformatics, I have used support vector machines to classify short E. coli DNA sequences. For this project, I have used a dataset from the UCI machine learning repository that has 106 DNA sequences, with 57 sequential nucleotides each. I was able to predict whether or not a short sequence of E.coli bacteria DNA was a predictor or non-promoter with 96% accuracy.
